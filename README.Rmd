The goal of `stepfinder` is to detect a step in one dimensional data. 

## Installation

**This package is yet to be released on CRAN.**
In the future, you will be able to install the released version of stepfinder from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("stepfinder")
```

For now, install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("matiasandina/stepfinder")
```

## Usage

> This package contains a semi-automated pipeline. This means the user will be prompted several times and should be familiar with the pipeline.

> Although these funcitons should work for any type of 1 dimensional data, there are a good number of references to animals. This is because the package was developed for detection of steps during tracking of animal positions.

### Data diagnostics

```{r example}
library(stepfinder)
```

Minimally, you would have a `data.frame` with 3 columns `frameID`, `x`, `y`. The first idea is to inspect the detections. The package provides examples under `data`. 

```{r load-data}
# load data
df <- read.csv("data/df.csv")
head(df)
```

```{r diagnose-detection, eval=FALSE}
diagnostic <- diagnose_detection(df)
```

> If your data does not have an `id` column, random IDs will be assigned on each run of `diagnose_detection()`.

```{r, echo=FALSE, comment=NA}

message("No id found, assigning random id.\nInternal id assignment is not reproducible, if IDs matter assign IDs beforehand!
")

```

You are prompted to see plots and diagnose whether detections were correct. 

```{r print-path, echo=FALSE, comment=NA}
message("Press [enter] to see animal path: >")
```

And to see the velocity plots.

```{r, echo=FALSE, comment=NA}
message("Press [enter] to see diagnostics: >")
```

![](sample_img/vel_1473.png)

Finally, you have to answer whether the detction was good or bad.

```{r, echo=FALSE, comment=NA}
message("Detection was correct [Yy/Nn]: >")
```

Here's an example of a wrong detection (Prompts not included).

```{r wrong-detection, eval=FALSE}
# read data
df_wrong <- read.csv("data/df_wrong.csv")
diagnostic <- diagnose_detection(df_wrong)

```

![](sample_img/path_8359.png)

The path does not make it clear that there were wrong detections. However, the errors are evident in velocity plots.

![](sample_img/vel_8359.png)

These plots also give a good estimate for the velocity we will set up as threshold for bad detections (see `v_thresh` in `?fix_detection_jumps`).

The idea is to do this process for multiple detections and later filter out those that need to be fixed.

You can easily run multiple detections wrapping the `diagnose_detection` in an `lapply` call. This applies to all the functions of the package. 

```{r multiple-diagnostic, eval=FALSE}
# Make list of dfs
list_of_df <- list(df, df_wrong)

lapply(list_of_df, function(t) diagnose_detection(t))

```

### Fixing detections

The workhorse for fixing detections is `fix_detection_jumps`. See `?fix_detection_jumps`. Basic example below.

### Convolution

The default uses derivatives to find the possible candidates and convolution to find whether there's a step around the candidates. Convolution is implemented through `find_step()`.

```{r fix-detections, eval=FALSE}
fix_detection_jumps(df)
```

### Just derivatives

### Manual

Sometimes, you have to go full manual. 

```{r fix-detections-manual, eval=FALSE}
fix_detection_jumps(df_wrong, manual_removal = TRUE)
```
